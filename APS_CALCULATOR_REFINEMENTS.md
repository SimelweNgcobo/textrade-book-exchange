# APS Calculator Refinements - Completed ✅

## Changes Made

### 1. **Default Subjects Added** ✅

- **Afrikaans** - Level 0 (counts for APS)
- **English** - Level 0 (counts for APS)
- **Mathematics** - Level 0 (counts for APS)
- **Life Orientation** - Level 0 (required but doesn't count for APS)

All four subjects are now pre-populated when users open the APS calculator.

### 2. **Life Orientation Special Handling** ✅

- Life Orientation is **required to be filled in** (shows in subjects list)
- **Does NOT count toward APS score** calculation
- Clear indication: "(Required but doesn't count for APS)" shown under Life Orientation
- APS total shows: "(Life Orientation not included)" for clarity

### 3. **Eligibility Percentage Removed** ✅

- Removed eligibility rate percentage from statistics
- Removed percentage progress bar
- Quick stats now show only:
  - Eligible Programs count
  - Total Programs count
  - Universities count

### 4. **Overview Tab Removed** ✅

- Completely removed the "Overview" tab
- Interface now shows single tab: "APS Calculator & Results"
- All content consolidated into the main calculator view
- Cleaner, more focused user experience

## Technical Implementation

### APS Calculation Logic

```typescript
// Only subjects with countsForAPS: true are included
const totalAPS = subjects
  .filter((subject) => subject.countsForAPS !== false)
  .reduce((total, subject) => total + subject.level, 0);
```

### Subject Structure

```typescript
interface APSSubject {
  name: string;
  level: number;
  countsForAPS?: boolean; // Life Orientation = false
}
```

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Immediate Start**: Users can start entering marks right away with pre-populated subjects
2. **Clear Requirements**: Life Orientation requirement is obvious but doesn't affect APS
3. **Simplified Interface**: Removed confusing percentage displays and extra tabs
4. **Focus on Results**: Single view focuses on what matters - eligible programs

## Result

The APS calculator now provides a streamlined experience where users:

- Start with essential subjects already added
- Understand Life Orientation's special status
- Focus on program eligibility without percentage distractions
- Have a cleaner, single-tab interface

All requirements have been implemented successfully and the build passes without issues.
