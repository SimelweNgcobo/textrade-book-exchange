# Bug Fix: Temporal Dead Zone Error in EnhancedAPSCalculatorV2

## âœ… Error Fixed Successfully

### **Original Error**

```
ReferenceError: Cannot access 'checkSubjectRequirements' before initialization
```

### **Root Cause**

The `checkSubjectRequirements` function was being called inside a `useMemo` hook (around line 148) before it was declared (line 249). This created a JavaScript **temporal dead zone** error where the function was accessed before it was initialized.

### **Error Location**

- **File**: `src/components/university-info/EnhancedAPSCalculatorV2.tsx`
- **Issue**: Function declaration order problem
- **Impact**: APS Calculator component crashed when trying to calculate degree eligibility

### **Solution Implemented**

1. **Added useCallback import**: Updated imports to include `useCallback` hook
2. **Moved helper functions**: Relocated both `normalizeSubjectName` and `checkSubjectRequirements` functions before the `useMemo` that uses them
3. **Converted to useCallback**: Changed from regular function declarations to `useCallback` hooks for proper dependency management
4. **Updated dependencies**: Added `checkSubjectRequirements` to the useMemo dependency array
5. **Removed duplicates**: Cleaned up duplicate function declarations that were left after the move

### **Code Changes**

**Before (Problematic)**:

```typescript
// useMemo using checkSubjectRequirements (line ~148)
const calculation = useMemo(() => {
  // ... code that calls checkSubjectRequirements
}, [subjects, ...]);

// Function declared later (line ~249)
const checkSubjectRequirements = (degree, userSubjects) => {
  // function implementation
};
```

**After (Fixed)**:

```typescript
// Helper functions declared first using useCallback
const normalizeSubjectName = useCallback((name: string) => {
  // implementation
}, []);

const checkSubjectRequirements = useCallback((degree, userSubjects) => {
  // implementation
}, [normalizeSubjectName]);

// useMemo can now safely use the functions
const calculation = useMemo(() => {
  // ... code that calls checkSubjectRequirements
}, [subjects, ..., checkSubjectRequirements]);
```

### **Verification**

- âœ… **Build Success**: `npm run build` completes without errors
- âœ… **HMR Update**: Hot module replacement working correctly
- âœ… **Runtime Fix**: APS Calculator component now loads without errors
- âœ… **Functionality**: All calculator features working as expected

### **Impact**

- **User Experience**: APS Calculator now works properly for all users
- **Error Elimination**: No more JavaScript runtime errors when accessing the calculator
- **Performance**: Proper useCallback usage optimizes re-renders
- **Maintainability**: Better code organization with proper function ordering

## ðŸš€ Status: RESOLVED

The temporal dead zone error has been completely resolved. The APS Calculator is now fully functional and the application builds successfully for production deployment.
