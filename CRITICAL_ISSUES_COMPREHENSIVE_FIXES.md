# Critical Issues - Comprehensive Fixes

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive fixes implemented to address the 18 critical, high-priority, and medium-priority errors identified in the university course assignment system. The fixes transform the system from one with silent failures and broken logic into a robust, validated, and user-friendly application.

## 🔴 CRITICAL ERRORS - FIXED

### 1. No APS filtering in program assignment ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Students saw programs they didn't qualify for or missed eligible programs due to lack of APS-based filtering.

**Solution Implemented**:

- Created `src/services/apsAwareCourseAssignmentService.ts` with comprehensive APS filtering
- Added `APSFilterOptions` interface supporting:
  - User APS score filtering
  - Subject requirement validation
  - "Almost qualified" threshold settings
  - Dynamic inclusion/exclusion rules
- Enhanced `getCoursesForUniversityWithAPS()` function that:
  - Validates user APS against program requirements
  - Checks subject prerequisites
  - Calculates eligibility gaps
  - Provides detailed feedback

**Files Modified**:

- `src/services/apsAwareCourseAssignmentService.ts` (NEW)
- `src/hooks/useAPSAwareCourseAssignment.ts` (NEW)
- `src/pages/EnhancedUniversityProfile.tsx` (NEW)

### 2. getCoursesForUniversity() relies solely on static rules ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Function only used static assignment rules without considering user-specific criteria.

**Solution Implemented**:

- Replaced static-only logic with dynamic filtering system
- Added `EnhancedCourseWithEligibility` interface that includes:
  - Real-time eligibility calculation
  - APS gap analysis
  - Subject match scoring
  - University-specific data integration
- Implemented comprehensive validation pipeline
- Added error handling for malformed data

**Key Improvements**:

```typescript
export function getCoursesForUniversityWithAPS(
  universityId: string,
  apsOptions: APSFilterOptions = {},
): CoursesForUniversityResult {
  // Comprehensive validation
  // Dynamic APS filtering
  // Subject requirement checking
  // Error handling with detailed feedback
}
```

### 3. getUniversitiesForCourse() logic validated and enhanced ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Missing error handling and validation for assignment rules.

**Solution Implemented**:

  ```typescript
  export const isDegreeValid = (degree: any): degree is Degree => {
    return degree &&
           typeof degree.id === "string" &&
           typeof degree.name === "string" &&
           // ... comprehensive checks
  };
  ```

  - By name (alphabetical)
  - By competitiveness level
- Implemented user-configurable sort preferences
- Added intelligent default sorting

### 11. No highlighting for matches ✅ FIXED
