# Fix Fly.io Deployment - Environment Variables

## Quick Fix Commands

Run these commands in your terminal where you have the Fly.io CLI installed:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd your-project-directory

# Set the required Supabase environment variables
fly secrets set VITE_SUPABASE_URL="https://kbpjqzaqbqukutflwixf.supabase.co"
fly secrets set VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImticGpxemFxYnF1a3V0Zmx3aXhmIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NDc1NjMzNzcsImV4cCI6MjA2MzEzOTM3N30.3EdAkGlyFv1JRaRw9OFMyA5AkkKoXp0hdX1bFWpLVMc"

# Optionally set other environment variables
fly secrets set VITE_APP_URL="https://c43f43e498c34254ab8103c04512c818-dec0e02b99334877878040d0a.fly.dev"

# Deploy with the new environment variables
fly deploy
```

## Verify Environment Variables

To check if the variables are set correctly:

```bash
# List all secrets (values will be hidden for security)
fly secrets list

# Check app status
fly status
```

## Alternative: Using fly.toml

You can also add environment variables to your `fly.toml` file (for non-sensitive variables):

```toml
[env]
  VITE_APP_URL = "https://your-app-url.fly.dev"
```

**Note**: Don't put sensitive keys like Supabase credentials in `fly.toml` as it's committed to version control.

## Expected Result

After running these commands:

1. The environment variables will be available to your app
2. The app will start successfully
3. You should see "âœ… Environment variables validated successfully" in the console
4. The Supabase client will initialize properly

## Troubleshooting

If you still get errors:

1. **Check if Fly CLI is logged in**:

   ```bash
   fly auth whoami
   ```

2. **Make sure you're in the right app context**:

   ```bash
   fly apps list
   fly app set your-app-name
   ```

3. **Verify the deployment**:
   ```bash
   fly logs
   ```

## Security Note

The environment variables I provided are the ones that were previously hardcoded in your application, so they are safe to use. However, for enhanced security, you should:

1. Consider rotating the Supabase anon key periodically
2. Set up Row Level Security (RLS) in your Supabase database
3. Monitor access logs in Supabase dashboard
