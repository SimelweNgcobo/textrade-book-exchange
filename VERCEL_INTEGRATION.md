# Vercel Analytics & Speed Insights Integration

This project has been integrated with Vercel Analytics and Speed Insights to monitor performance and user behavior.

## Components Integrated

### 1. Vercel Analytics

- **Package**: `@vercel/analytics`
- **Version**: `^1.5.0`
- **Purpose**: Track page views, user interactions, and conversion metrics
- **Location**: Added to `src/App.tsx`

### 2. Vercel Speed Insights

- **Package**: `@vercel/speed-insights`
- **Version**: `^1.2.0`
- **Purpose**: Monitor Core Web Vitals and performance metrics
- **Location**: Added to `src/App.tsx`

## Implementation Details

The components are added to the root level of the application in `src/App.tsx`:

```tsx
import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/react";
import { SpeedInsights } from "@vercel/speed-insights/react";

function App() {
  return (
    <ErrorBoundary>
      <AuthErrorBoundary>
        {/* ... rest of app ... */}

        {/* Vercel Analytics and Speed Insights */}
        <Analytics />
        <SpeedInsights />
      </AuthErrorBoundary>
    </ErrorBoundary>
  );
}
```

## What Gets Tracked

### Analytics

- Page views across all routes
- User interactions and events
- Conversion tracking
- Geographic and demographic data
- Traffic sources and referrers

### Speed Insights

- Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)
- First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- Time to First Byte (TTFB)
- Performance scores
- Real user monitoring data

## Viewing Data

After deployment to Vercel:

1. **Analytics Dashboard**: Visit your Vercel project dashboard → Analytics tab
2. **Speed Insights**: Visit your Vercel project dashboard → Speed Insights tab
3. **Real-time Data**: Data appears within minutes of deployment
4. **Historical Data**: Full analytics available after 24-48 hours

## Privacy & GDPR Compliance

- Vercel Analytics is GDPR compliant by default
- No personal data is collected without user consent
- Analytics data is anonymized
- Users can opt-out through browser settings

## Local Development

- Components are loaded in development but don't send data
- No API keys or configuration required
- Data collection only happens on Vercel-deployed domains

## Environment Variables

No additional environment variables are required. The components automatically detect the deployment environment and only collect data on production Vercel deployments.

## Performance Impact

- **Bundle Size**: Minimal increase (~2-3KB gzipped)
- **Runtime Performance**: Negligible impact on app performance
- **Loading**: Components load asynchronously without blocking the main thread

## Troubleshooting

If data doesn't appear:

1. Ensure the app is deployed to Vercel (not just any hosting)
2. Wait 24-48 hours for full data collection to begin
3. Check that the components are properly imported and rendered
4. Verify the domain is correctly linked to your Vercel project
